## Getting Started

To train Dave2 model from scratch, run the following command:

```bash
python mh_dave2_train.py
```

To evaluate Dave2 models, both from scratch and pretrained (Github), run the following command:

```bash
python mh_dave2_eval.py
```

The result will be saved as a latex table in the file `eval.tex`.
